# Warp Terminal

Warp Terminal is an Agentic Development Environment designed to help developers ship faster by leveraging AI agents. Built with Rust for high performance and featuring a modern user experience, Warp revolutionizes how you interact with your terminal.

## Key Features:

### **Warp AI**
Warp intelligently auto-detects whether you are typing a natural language prompt or a traditional command. This allows you to seamlessly switch between modes:
- Use natural language prompts to have Warp write code for you.
- Debug issues with AI assistance.
- Generate complex commands based on your descriptions.

### **Multi-Agent Management**
Designed to run multiple AI agents concurrently, Warp ensures you stay informed and in control:
- Agents send notifications when they require your input.
- A dedicated panel allows you to monitor and manage all your active agents.

### **Warp Code**
Optimized for code generation, Warp facilitates writing code by prompt, even on large, existing codebases:
- When an opportunity for code generation is detected, Warp enters an advanced code generation flow.
- This feature streamlines development by automating repetitive coding tasks and assisting with complex implementations.

### **Warp Drive**
Warp Drive provides integrated tools for personal and team use, enhancing your development workflow:
- **Notebooks**: Organize and execute your commands and notes.
- **Workflows**: Browse, search, execute, and share predefined command sequences, with support for parameterized arguments and intelligent resolution.
- **Environment Variables**: Manage your environment settings efficiently.
All Warp Drive data serves as valuable context for Warp AI, improving its intelligence and relevance.

### **Modern UX and Text Editing**
Experience a terminal designed for efficiency and customization:
- **Blocks**: Inputs (commands or prompts) and their corresponding outputs are grouped into intuitive blocks for easy readability and management.
- **Navigation**: Navigate through your terminal history with ease using your cursor or customizable keybindings.
- **Input Editor**: A highly optimized input editor provides a seamless typing experience.

### **Customization**
Warp is built to adapt to your unique preferences:
- Fully customize its appearance with comprehensive theme support, including built-in themes and user-definable YAML themes.
- Tailor AI prompts to your specific needs.
- Adjust settings and keybindings to optimize your workflow.

## Compatibility:
Warp works seamlessly with popular shells:
- `zsh`
- `bash`
- `fish`
- `PowerShell`

## Performance:
Built with Rust, Warp offers a high-performance terminal experience, ensuring speed and responsiveness even with demanding workloads.
